WindNinja WRF Configuration File README
This document serves as a guide for utilizing a specific WindNinja CLI (Command Line Interface) configuration file. The file is designed for initiating WindNinja simulations with a domain average initialization method.

RUNNING THE TEST CASE
Important Note: Python 3 or a later version is required to run the script.

To execute this test case, run the following command in the stability_case directory:

python stability_case.py

The results will be generated in the stability_case directory.

CONFIGURATION FILE DETAILS
The .cfg file includes the following settings for CLI runs. For a comprehensive list of required settings, refer to windninja/doc/CLI_instructions.pdf.

num_threads: Number of threads for parallel processing in the simulation.
elevation_file: Location of the elevation data file.
initialization_method: Set to domainAverageInitialization.
input_speed: Wind speed for input.
input_direction: Direction of the input wind.
input_wind_height: Height for wind speed measurement.
output_wind_height: Height for wind output generation.
vegetation: Vegetation cover type.
mesh_choice: Determines the resolution of the computational mesh.
write_goog_output:Booleans to generate Google Earth output.
write_shapefile_output: Booleans to generate Shapefile output.
write_ascii_output: Boolean to generate ASCII output.
ascii_out_resolution: ASCII output resolution.
units_ascii_out_resolution: Units for the ASCII output resolution.
write_farsite_atm: Set to true to enable writing FARSITE atmosphere files.
